# 66DaysOfData

## Day 0: 31 Aug 2022

- setup roadmap
- Learned about structural pattern matching in python 3.10
  - `shlex.split()` - Split the string s using shell-like syntax
  - `print(f"{var!r}`") - !r calls repr instead of str
  - cons: order of patterns have effects and wicked switching -> leads to bad design decisions, fucntion starts to lose cohesion
- watched some of lecture 3 of fsdl, learned about software testing.
  - think of test suits as a classifier, outputs pass/fail
  - trade off detection and false alarms, few missed alarms and false alarms
  - 80/20 rule for testing -> only 80% of value are from 20% of effort spent on test.
  - testing tools: pytest, doctest (for documentation), codecov
  - clean code tools: black, flake8, shellcheck (shell scripting)
  - in SWE: source code -> program with compiler
  - in ML: data -> model with training (much harder to test)
